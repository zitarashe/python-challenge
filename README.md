I created a Python script to analyse the financial records of this company.

PyBank

The dataset had two columns  “Date” and “Profit/Losses”.

I created a Python script that analyses the records to calculate the following values:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll
In this step I was helping a small, rural U.S town modernise it’s vote-counting process.
The dataset had three columns “Voter ID” , “County” and “Candidate”. I created a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following values:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
